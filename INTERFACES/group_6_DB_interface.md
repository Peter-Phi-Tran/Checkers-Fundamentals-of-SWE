Players will be stored in a LinkedList<Player>
-When a player wins or loses, their stats will be updated in the list
-To persist data, the list will be saved to a text file
-Each player's data will be stored as a line in the file
(UUID,username,wins,losses,totalWins,elo)
-When the program starts, it will read from the file to restore the player list

We have spoken with page mgr, pair up, and game termi. we are all pretty much on the same page about how we are going to be storing certain parts of the project.
